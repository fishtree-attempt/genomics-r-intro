title: Using packages from Bioconductor
teaching: 30
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How do I use packages from the Bioconductor repository?"
objectives:
- "Describe what the Bioconductor repository is and what it is used for"
- "Describe how Bioconductor differs from CRAN"
- "Search Bioconductor for relevent packages"
- "Install a package from Bioconductor"
keypoints:
- "Bioconductor is an alternative package repository for bioinformatics packages."
- "Installing packages from Bioconductor requires a new method, since it is not compatible with the `install.packages()` function used for CRAN."
- "Check Bioconductor to see if there is a package relevent to your analysis before writing code yourself."
